#### Motivation: The Overpowered Golden State Warriors.
The 2015-2016 Golden State Warriors (GSW) turned heads by winning a staggering _73 games out of an 82 game season_, an nba record for [most wins in a season](https://www.nba.com/history/top-moments/golden-state-warriors-win-73-games). However, they fell short of winning the championship. 

After the Warriors' collapse in the finals- blowing a 3-1 lead to the Cleveland Cavaliers, they looked to boost the roster to make come back even stronger the next year. A few weeks after the season was over, free agent Kevin Durant expressed interest in joining them. At a meeting in the Hamptons on New York's Long island, the Warriors sent four of their best players: Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andre Iguodala, and Draymond Green to convince Durant to sign with the Warriors. Even though their record breaking season ended in dissapointment, the Warriors' consolation prize was [adding a former MVP and 4 time scoring champion, Kevin Durant to an already stacked roster](https://www.nba.com/history/top-moments/kevin-durant-signs-warriors-2016). Thus, the ["Hampton 5"](https://www.si.com/nba/2018/golden-state-warriors-hamptons-five-nickname-origin-history) lineup was born. 

With a stacked roster, the Warriors have positioned themselves to rise as the NBA's new dynasty for years to come, generating talks of comparison to the the Michael Jordan's legendary '96 Chicago Bulls.

####Background: Record Breaking stars
Led by the __Hampton 5__ lineup who closed out most games, the Warriors crushed the 2016 season. On the way to a 67-15 season, the Warriors ran over the competition, finishing with a +11.63 point differential ([the fourth highest of all time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2016%E2%80%9317_Golden_State_Warriors_season)).


Klay Thompson became the [first player to ever scored 60 points under 30 minutes](http://www.espn.com/blog/golden-state-warriors/post/_/id/2976/klay-what-thompson-dropped-60-and-it-could-have-been-more), dropping 60 points in a win against the Pacers in 29 minutes on December 5, 2016. "Chef" Steph Curry broke the [NBA record for three-pointers made in a game](https://www.nba.com/article/2016/11/08/curry-record-3-pointers
): he made 13 3-point shots against the Pelicans on November 6, 2016, cementing his bid for greatest shooter ever. Draymond Green became the first player to record [a triple-double without 10 points](https://www.sbnation.com/2017/2/10/14584492/draymond-green-triple-double-nba-history-warriors-vs-grizzlies): against the Grizzlies on Feburary 10, 2017, Green had 12 rebounds, 10 assists, 10 steals, and 5 blocks. 


The warriors Wrapped up the regular season with the best record in the league. However, the job was not complete yet. 

>"No one remembers second place," Warriors forward Draymond Green said. "No one cares who lost in the Finals. It's about winning. We're there, that's the first step, now it's about winning."

Playing with the stinging memories of losing the last year's final, the Warriors pushed on the gas and cruised through the playoffs, sweeping the Western Conference. Entering the finals undefeated at [12-0](https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/playoffs/2017/05/22/warriors-sweep-spurs-advance-nba-finals/102032554/) had never been done before. In a rematch with Lebron James and the Cavaliers, the Warriors dropped only one game in a gentleman's sweep, winning 4-1. In doing so, they set another record: a historic [16-1](https://www.google.com/search?q=16-1%20playoff%20record) playoff performance, the best post-season record the NBA has ever seen. 

Kevin Durant was named the unanimous [finals MVP](https://www.nba.com/article/2017/06/13/kevin-durant-earns-finals-mvp), averaging 35.2 points, 8.4 rebounds and 5.4 assists, while shooting 60 of 102 (.588) from the field throughout the finals. Nothing came easy for Durant:

>“I couldn’t sleep for two days,” Durant said.  “I was anxious.  I was jittery.  I put in all the work and had to trust in it.”

But in the end, the Warriors were well on their way to creating the league's new dynasty.
